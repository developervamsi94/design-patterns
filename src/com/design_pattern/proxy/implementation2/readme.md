In Java, the InvocationHandler interface and the Proxy class are used together to implement dynamic proxy objects, which allow for flexible and runtime manipulation of method invocations on objects. Here's how they work:

**InvocationHandler Interface:**
The InvocationHandler interface is part of the java.lang.reflect package.
It contains a single method called invoke(Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args) that is invoked whenever a method is called on a dynamic proxy object.
This method allows you to intercept method invocations on the proxy object and define custom behavior to be executed before or after delegating the method call to the actual target object.
You can implement this interface to define your custom logic for method invocation.

**Proxy Class:**
The Proxy class is also part of the java.lang.reflect package.
It provides static methods for creating dynamic proxy objects at runtime.
The newProxyInstance(ClassLoader loader, Class<?>[] interfaces, InvocationHandler h) method of the Proxy class is used to create a new dynamic proxy instance.
This method takes three parameters:
loader: the class loader to define the proxy class.
interfaces: an array of interfaces that the proxy class should implement.
h: an InvocationHandler object that will handle method invocations on the proxy object.
When a method is invoked on the dynamic proxy object, the invoke method of the specified InvocationHandler is called, allowing you to define custom behavior.

**Use Cases:**
Dynamic proxy objects are often used for implementing cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, transaction management, etc., in a non-intrusive way.
They are also used in various frameworks and libraries for providing features like remote method invocation (RMI), dependency injection (DI), and aspect-oriented programming (AOP).
By using dynamic proxies, you can separate concerns and keep your code modular and maintainable.
Example:
Here's a simple example demonstrating the use of InvocationHandler and Proxy to create a dynamic proxy object:

In this example, we define an interface `MyInterface`, a class `MyInvocationHandler` that implements InvocationHandler, 
and a Main class that demonstrates the usage of dynamic proxy objects. 
The Main class creates a dynamic proxy object for MyInterface using Proxy.newProxyInstance method, and all method invocations on the proxy object are intercepted by the invoke method of MyInvocationHandler.
